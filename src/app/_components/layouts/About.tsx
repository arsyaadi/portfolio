              Hello! My name is Arsya Adi Setiawan Putra, a software engineer
              based in Yogyakarta. I enjoy the process of building things on the
              internet, particularly in the development of exceptional websites,
              web applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started pursuing my interest in software development in 2021.
              Shortly after that, I joined the engineering team at{" "}
              <a href="https://refactory.id/" className="text-aquamarine">
                Refactory.id
              </a>
              &nbsp; where I got involved in various interesting and meaningful
              projects every day.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe that software development is an art that requires
              creativity, perseverance, and precision. I am committed to
              continuous learning and expanding my knowledge in this
              ever-evolving field. I am ready to take on new challenges and
              contribute to the fullest in every project I participate in.
            </p>

            <p>Here are a few technologies Iâ€™ve been working with recently:</p>

                  {skill}
                </li>
              );
            })}
